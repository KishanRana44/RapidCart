<h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>
The <b>RapidCart-Online Shopping System</b> is a web platform for quick commerce that allows
customers to search, choose, and purchase products online from any location, with fast
delivery. Earlier, people had to visit busy markets and wait in long lines to shop, but now
they can order from home and save both time and effort. This system avoids the problems of
crowded markets and long waits, giving customers an easy, secure, and fast way to shop.
Customers can search for items, place them in a cart, complete secure payments, and get
quick confirmation. Customers can track their orders live, and delivery usually takes 20–30
minutes if the store is within 8–10 km of their location. The system’s backend helps sellers
manage stock, prices, and orders easily. It also works with delivery services to improve
routes and reduce delays.<br>
This platform helps customers with convenience and speed, helps sellers run their business
more smoothly, and helps delivery partners save time with better routes. It is made with
modern web technologies, works on any device, has secure payment options, and keeps data
safe in the cloud.<br>
The <b>RapidCart-Online Shopping System</b> brings together easy online shopping and fast
delivery to match the needs of modern lifestyles. It gives a complete solution for modern
retail, improving customer satisfaction and making business operations more effective.
